# hesitant assembly project
the goal of the project is help the user who feels quite hesitant about making some choice 
although it may have a con which the user can enter a fixed number of inputs which is 4
how to solve it?
until I find a way to fix this issue here's some tips.
we know that the inputs can't be less than 2 and it's hard to be more than 9 so:
1- in case the user's inputs are less than 4, if it is 2 then the user can enter each of them twice which still gives each of them the same posibility. if it is 3 then the user can enter all of them and leave the last one empty though it might be irritaiting so we will work on this issue soon.
2- in case the inputs are more than 4. the user shall devide them in a good way to play twice and put the chosen options of the two times together in a new round.

although it might not be perfect but i am sure some users would like the idea of this as you might need something to make some decision for you but of course not a big one. just to help you pick a resturant or a movie or even a subject to study.
